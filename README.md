<h2>Breakout Game</h2>
<p>One of my portfolio projects from 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp </p>

<h4>Project Approach</h4>

<p>I started by outlining the flow of the game.&nbsp; This included the starting and finishing GUI of the game, as well as the gameplay itself.&nbsp; This covered the game's core mechanics, features and GUI. </p>

<p>As I researched into the features I wanted the game to have I realised the limitations of the <code>turtle</code> library, such as mouse control, game images, and most importantly game performance.&nbsp; This led me to using <code>turtle</code> along with the <code>tkinter</code> and <code>pillow</code> libraries. </p>

<p>By using these libraries to show the game objects in place of the turtle objects, I was able to increase the game performance greatly, allowing me to incorporate all the game features I was hoping for, as well as more capabilities with game images as well as user mouse control. </p>

<p>Once I understood the game features and mechanics I was able to plan out my classes for an OOP design.&nbsp; </p>

<p><br></p>

<h4>What was hard, what was easy?</h4>

<p>With a good amount of practice using these libraries now, the syntax was the easy part of this project.&nbsp; The challenge was bringing it all together over the different libraries, while maintaining clean and organised code.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Designing the ball's bounce physics was also a more challenging part of this project as I wanted the ball to have a full 360 degree range of motion that varied with the paddle contact location.&nbsp; This involved many calculations as well as some trigonometry revision.</p>

<p><br></p>

<h4>Biggest learning from today?</h4>

<p>This project gave me a better understanding of an OOP design and keeping the code clean in the process.&nbsp; This also led me to also learning more about creating classes to hold data, as well as working with enumerations.</p>

<p>Having to consider game performance each step was also a great learning experience.&nbsp; As I added more features I had to assess what kind of control statements, methods, data structures, a algorithms I had to use to keep the game running smoothly while keeping all the features I hoped to include.</p>

<p><br></p>

<h4>What would I do differently? </h4>

<p>Although I'm happy with what I was able to achieve using the <code>turtle</code>&nbsp; library,&nbsp; I think using a library such as <code>pygame</code>&nbsp; may have been a better approach considering the game features I wanted to implement.</p>
